## Overview

This page explains how to register as a validator on Ronin.
After following the steps in this guide, you'll become a
Validator Candidate and have a chance to be selected as a
Standard Validator on the next day.

### Validator responsibilities and rewards

Ronin Validators share the critical responsibility of ensuring the integrity of all onchain transactions. That means they produce blocks and vote for finality. Ronin has allocated a total of [180M RON](./../../basics/rewards.md) over 8 years to reward Validators for these contributions, and Validators also receive a percentage of Ronin transaction fees.

The rewards are divided into two parts: 85% for finality voting and 15% for block production. All validators vote for finality, but only 22 validators are selected produce blocks in a given epoch. 
These 22 validators include 12 Governing Validators, elected by the community to ensure network security, and 10 Rotating Validators selected randomly. The probability of being chosen as a Rotating Validator is proportional to the amount of stake held by each validator

After receiving rewards, validators then re-distribute a small percentage to Delegators according to a commission rate, which can range from 5% to 20%.




## Prerequisites

Have at least 250,000 RON for the initial stake in your Ronin address. For information on how to buy RON, see [Acquire RON](./../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).
**Note: An address applying to become a validator must not have participated in staking previously, either as a validator or a delegator.**

## Steps

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com/), then click **Become a Validator**.

4. Fill in your addresses, the commission rate, the fast finality vote key, and the proof of possession. For more information, see [Add or change finality vote key](./manage/finality.mdx). **Note:** The tool generating the keys produces them without the `0x` prefix. Before submitting the form, make sure to add the `0x` prefix to the keys.
