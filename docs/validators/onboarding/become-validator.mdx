## Overview

This page explains how to register as a validator on Ronin.
After following the steps in this guide, you'll become a
Validator Candidate and have a chance to be selected as a
Standard Validator on the next day.

### Validator roles

There are three validator roles:

* **Validator Candidate:** the role you get after following the steps
in this guide. Validator Candidates are eligible to be selected as Standard Validators the next day.
* **Standard Validator:** all validators participate in the finality voting. 
10 Rotating Validators are randomly selected every 10 minutes based on their staked amount to produce blocks.
* **Governing Validator:** the validators chosen by the community and
Sky Mavis to ensure network security. Governing Validators are
validators by default, and they account for more than half of the
total validator set, who actively produce blocks.

## Prerequisites

Have at least 250,000 RON for the initial stake in your Ronin Wallet. For information on how to buy RON, see [Acquire RON](./../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).

## Steps

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com/), then click **Become a Validator**.

4. Fill in your addresses, the commission rate, the fast finality vote key, and the proof of possession. For more information, see [Add or change finality vote key](../manage/finality.mdx). **Note:** The tool generating the keys produces them without the `0x` prefix. Before submitting the form, make sure to add the `0x` prefix to the keys.
