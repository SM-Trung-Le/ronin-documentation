## Overview

When you provide liquidity to a pool on Katana, you receive liquidity pool (LP) tokens in return. You can stake these LP tokens in a farm to earn rewards in the form of another ERC-20 token, which is chosen by the farm creator. A farm can offer more than one reward token to choose from. Generally, the more LP tokens you stake, the more reward tokens you earn. Farming is available for a limited number of pools at any given time.

## Prerequisites

To farm tokens on Katana, you need to have LP tokens that you can stake. To acquire LP tokens, add your liquidity to a pool. For more information, see [Add liquidity to a pool](add-liquidity.mdx).

## Start farming

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Liquidity pool** page, then turn on the **Farms only** filter to show the pools that offer farm rewards. All farming pools are displayed with a yellow lightning symbol and RON icon to the right side of the pool's name.

3. Select the pool you want to farm tokens in, then click the **Farm rewards** tab, and then select **Stake**. This opens the **Stake** panel for staking your LP tokens. In the **My position** panel, you can see how many tokens you have staked and how many are available in your wallet.

## Stop farming

To stop farming, you need to unstake the LP tokens from a farm pool. Unstaking means that you stop receiving reward tokens proportionate to how much LP tokens you unstake.

1. Select the pool you want to unstake from, then click the **Farm rewards** tab, and then select **Unstake**. This opens the **Unstake** panel for unstaking your LP tokens.

2. Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to unstake, then click **Unstake**.

    ![Enter unstake amount](../assets/katana-farm-unstake-amount.png)

Confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet. When the transaction completes, Katana displays a confirmation pop-up.

After unstaking, you can see an update in your total LP tokens staked and available in wallet reflective of the changes you made.
