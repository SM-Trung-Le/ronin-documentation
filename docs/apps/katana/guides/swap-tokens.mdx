## Overview

You can trade one token for another on Katana in a process known as swapping. When swapping tokens, you sell the currently owned tokens for the proportional amount of the tokens that you want to buy, minus the swap fee. The swap fee is awarded to liquidity providers (LPs).

### Swap on Ronin app vs Ronin Wallet

There are two ways to swap on Ronin: the [Swap](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) page in the Ronin web app and the Wallet Swap feature in the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) mobile app and browser extension. The process is similar in both, but the interface differs slightly.

### Swap fees in Katana v2 vs v3

The fees for swapping tokens on Katana vary depending on the version of the AMM protocol being used: Katana v2 or Katana v3.

#### Katana v2

| Fee amount | Fee breakdown |
| --- | --- |
| 0.3% | 0.25% LP fee + 0.05% Ronin Treasury fee |

When using Wallet Swap, a development fee of 0.5% is added to the total fee, making it 0.8%.

#### Katana v3

| Fee tier | Fee breakdown | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.01% | 0.005% LP fee + 0.005% Ronin Treasury fee | Stablecoin pairs |
| 0.3% | 0.25% LP fee + 0.05% Ronin Treasury fee | Most trading pairs |
| 1% | 0.85% LP fee + 0.15% Ronin Treasury fee | High-volatility pairs |

## Prerequisites

To swap tokens, you need to have them in your Ronin Wallet. You can acquire tokens by depositing from Ethereum using [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge), buying through the [Purchase](https://purchase.roninchain.com) page, or receiving from other users.
For more information, see [Acquire RON](../../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).

## Swap in Ronin app

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet. The **Swap** page opens by default.

    ![Swap to list](../assets/katana-swap-to-list.png)
    
3. Enter the amount to swap by typing in either of the token selection boxes. When you type in on one of them, the other populates based on the current exchange rate between the tokens. When you are ready to swap, click **Swap**.

4. In the **Confirm Swap** pop-up, review the details of your swap:
    * **Rate**: The exchange rate between the tokens.
    * **Price impact**: estimation of the slippage to expect based on your order size and market movements. This gives you an idea of how much you can receive.
    * **Max. slippage**: the highest percent of price movement of the transaction. Anything greater than this value results in a failed transaction.
    * **Minimum receive**: the lowest amount of tokens you can receive based on slippage tolerance. This is the worst-case scenario. Anything less than this value results in a failed transaction.
    * **Liquidity provider fee**: the fees allocated to liquidity providers.
    * **Route**: the trading route taken for your order. It can be a direct "token A to token B" route, or there might be a bridge token in the middle, such as "token A through token B to token C." The direct route might not always be the cheapest.
    
    When you're ready, click **Confirm Swap**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

Your transaction is now submitted to the blockchain. When it completes, Katana displays a confirmation pop-up. Close it or click **View on explorer** to see the detailed information about the transaction.

Congratulations. You just swapped your tokens on Katana.
