## Overview

You can add more liquidity to an existing pool on Katana to earn fees from transactions. When you contribute liquidity to a pool, you receive liquidity pool (LP) tokens in return. These tokens represent your share in the pool and entitle you to a portion of the trading fees generated by the pool's transactions, directly proportional to your contribution.
You can also remove your liquidity from a pool at any time. Removing pool tokens converts your position back into underlying tokens at the current rate, proportional to your share of the pool. Accrued fees are included in the amounts you receive.

## Add liquidity to a pool

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Liquidity pool** page, then open the pool you want to contribute to.

3. Enter the amount of tokens you want to contribute, then click **Add**. Katana automatically calculates the equivalent amount of the other token based on the current exchange rate. You may need to approve both tokens in your Ronin Wallet if you interact with them for the first time.

4. Review the details of your liquidity contribution:
    * The amount of LP tokens you will get in return.
    * The amount of tokens you are contributing.
    * The share of the pool you will receive.

    Click **Confirm add liquidity**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.
